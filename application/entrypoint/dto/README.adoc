= Clean Architecture: EntryPoint DTO Module

This module is responsible for facilitating data transformation between core business domain models and external interfaces using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs). By leveraging the power of Quarkus and the `io.quarkus:quarkus-jackson` dependency, this module streamlines data serialization and deserialization, promoting efficient data interchange.

== Module Overview

The `entrypoint/dto` module plays a crucial role in maintaining a clear boundary between the core business domain and external interfaces. It enables consistent and controlled transformation of data, ensuring that data passed between layers remains coherent and adheres to Clean Architecture principles.

== Java Base Package

The Java base package for this module is: `com.nauth.example.entrypoint.dto`

== Key Responsibilities

- Implement transformations between core domain models and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).
- Utilize the `io.quarkus:quarkus-jackson` dependency for efficient JSON serialization and deserialization.

== Dependencies

This module depends on the following modules:

- `domain/model`: Provides core domain models.
- `io.quarkus:quarkus-jackson`: Enhances data serialization and deserialization capabilities.

== Usage

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/entrypoint/dto` directory.
2. Open the `build.gradle` file and ensure the necessary dependencies are defined, including `io.quarkus:quarkus-jackson`.
3. Implement transformation logic to ensure consistent data interchange between core domain models and DTOs.
