= Clean Architecture: EntryPoint API Module

This module serves as the entry point for our Clean Architecture project, exposing HTTP REST controllers to serve microservices endpoints.

== Module Overview

The `entrypoint/api` module is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and directing them to the appropriate business use cases defined in the `business/usecase` module. It acts as a bridge between external clients and the core business logic, ensuring that the Clean Architecture's boundaries are maintained.

== Key Responsibilities

- Exposes REST endpoints to serve various microservices.
- Transforms incoming requests into input for the corresponding use cases.
- Orchestrates the interaction between external clients and the business use cases.
- Enforces validation and input sanitization at the entry point.

== Usage

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/application/entrypoint/api` directory.
2. Implement your REST controllers, mapping them to appropriate use cases.

== Dependencies

- `business/usecase` for executing business logic.
- `domain/model` for accessing domain entities and models.
