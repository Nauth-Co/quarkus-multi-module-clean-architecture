= Clean Architecture: EntryPoint API Module

This module defines RESTful API endpoints that serve as entry points for external clients to interact with our microservices. It orchestrates communication between the external world and our application's core business logic.

== Module Overview

The `entrypoint/api` module acts as a gateway, exposing REST endpoints for external clients to interact with our microservices. It's responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests, marshaling data between external clients and our application's core, and ensuring adherence to Clean Architecture principles.

== Java Base Package

The Java base package for this module is: `com.nauth.example.entrypoint.api`

== Key Responsibilities

- Define RESTful API endpoints using Quarkus annotations and reactive programming concepts.
- Ensure that API endpoints communicate with the core business logic via the `business/usecase` module.
- Leverage shared Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) from the `entrypoint/dto` module to standardize API operations independently of protocols.

== Dependencies

This module depends on the following modules:

- `domain/model`: Provides core domain models.
- `business/usecase`: Implements business use cases and logic.
- `entrypoint/dto`: Contains shared Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for standardized API operations.

== Usage

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/entrypoint/api` directory.
2. Open the `build.gradle` file and ensure the correct dependencies are defined.
3. Implement your RESTful API endpoints using Quarkus annotations and reactive programming.
4. Utilize shared Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) from the `entrypoint/dto` module to standardize API operations.
