= Clean Architecture: EntryPoint GraphQL Module

This module defines GraphQL schemas and resolvers to provide an additional layer of interaction for external clients with our microservices. It empowers clients to request precisely the data they need, promoting efficiency in data exchange.

== Module Overview

The `entrypoint/graphql` module acts as an interface for external clients to interact with our microservices using the GraphQL query language. By defining schemas and resolvers, we enable clients to query and retrieve data in a tailored and efficient manner. This module maintains clear separation between layers and is the gateway for modern API interaction.

== Java Base Package

The Java base package for this module is: `com.nauth.example.entrypoint.graphql`

== Key Responsibilities

- Define GraphQL schemas using Quarkus annotations to represent the data structure of available queries and types.
- Implement resolvers that bridge schema definitions with the core business logic in the `business/usecase` module.
- Leverage shared Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) from the `entrypoint/dto` module to ensure consistent data representation.

== Dependencies

This module depends on the following modules:

- `domain/model`: Provides core domain models.
- `entrypoint/dto`: Implements transformations between domain models and DTOs.
- `business/usecase`: Implements business logic and use cases.
- `io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-graphql`: Quarkus extension for GraphQL support.

== Usage

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/entrypoint/graphql` directory.
2. Open the `build.gradle` file and ensure the necessary dependencies are defined.
3. Define your GraphQL schemas using Quarkus annotations and establish relationships between types.
4. Implement GraphQL resolvers that connect schema definitions to core business logic.
5. Utilize shared Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) from the `entrypoint/dto` module for consistent data representation.
