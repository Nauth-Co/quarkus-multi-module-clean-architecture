= Clean Architecture: Application Microservice Module

This module assembles the application logic and business use cases to create microservices ready for deployment.

== Module Overview

The `application/microservice` module acts as the glue that brings together the business use cases defined in the `business/usecase` module and orchestrates them into deployable microservices. It's responsible for handling the setup and configuration of Quarkus applications, ensuring that our Clean Architecture principles are seamlessly translated into functional microservices.

== Java Base Package

The Java base package for this module is: `com.nauth.example.application.microservice`

== Key Responsibilities

- Assemble the application by configuring and starting Quarkus.
- Wire up the business use cases to corresponding entry points, whether they are REST controllers, GraphQL resolvers, or other communication channels.
- Ensure that the assembled microservice adheres to Clean Architecture's layer separation and principles.

== Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/application/microservice` directory.
3. Implement your microservice assembly logic, configuring Quarkus, and connecting entry points to business use cases.

== Dependencies

This module may depend on the following:

- `domain/core` for executing business logic.
- `entrypoint/api` for exposing REST endpoints.
- `entrypoint/graphql` for defining GraphQL schema and resolvers.
- `infrastructure/data` for persistence logic.
- `service/adapter` for external libraries integration.
- `client/rest` for external rest json services integration.
- `client/soap` for external wsdl soap services integration.

== Build and Run

1. Make sure your project is synchronized using Gradle.
2. Implement your microservice assembly logic.
3. Run your microservice using the appropriate Gradle tasks or Quarkus commands.
