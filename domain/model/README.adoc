- Implement general utilities or helper classes that can be reused across different layers of the application.
- Emphasize data consistency, validation, and other domain-specific logic within the models.

== Usage

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/domain/model` directory.
2. Define your domain models and general utilities that form the core data structures and logic of the business domain.

== Dependencies
