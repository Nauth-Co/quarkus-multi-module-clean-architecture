The Java base package for this module is: `com.nauth.example.domain.core`

== Key Responsibilities

- Implement business use cases and logic that define the core behavior of the application.
- Define domain models that encapsulate the key entities and data structures within the business domain.
- Emphasize the business rules and logic, maintaining the integrity and coherence of the application.

== Usage

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/domain/core` directory.
2. Implement your business use case interfaces and shared domain models that define the core application behavior.

== Dependencies

This module may depend on the following:
- `business/repository` for data access operations.
- `business/service` for integrated external service interactions.
- `business/usecase` for implementing business logic.
- `infrastructure/properties` for access to mapped environment properties (runtime or buildtime).
