= Clean Architecture: Business Service Module

This module is responsible for encapsulating integration logic between our core domain models and external service contracts. As a key component of the `business` layer, the `business-service` module bridges the gap between internal business logic and external service interactions. By managing these integrations, this module ensures that the core business logic remains insulated from the complexities of external services.

== Module Overview

The `business-service` module acts as a critical intermediary layer, orchestrating the interaction between core domain models and external services. This includes handling data transformations, request-response interactions, error handling, and more. By encapsulating these integration responsibilities, this module maintains the separation of concerns and promotes modularity.

== Java Base Package

The Java base package for this module is: `com.nauth.example.business.service`

== Key Responsibilities

- Manage the integration between core domain models and external service contracts.
- Implement logic for transforming data, handling external API calls, and managing responses.

== Dependency on the `domain-model` Module

The `business-service` module depends on the `domain-model` module to establish a direct relationship with core domain models. This ensures that the service contracts defined in this module align seamlessly with the core domain models they interact with.

== Dependencies

This module depends on the following modules:

- `domain/model`: Provides core domain models.

== Configuration Steps

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/business/service` directory.
2. Open the `build.gradle` file and ensure the necessary dependencies, including `domain-model`, are defined.
3. Define the integration logic that connects core domain models with external service contracts.

== Usage

1. Implement data transformations, error handling, and request-response interactions in alignment with external service contracts.
2. Ensure that the `domain-model` module's domain models are integrated appropriately.
3. Test and validate the integration logic to ensure proper functionality.
