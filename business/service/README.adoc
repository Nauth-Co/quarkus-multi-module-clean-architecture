= Clean Architecture: Business Service Module

This module defines interfaces for integrated external service operations, promoting a clear separation between business logic and external integrations.

== Module Overview

The `business/service` module focuses on defining interfaces that represent integrated external service operations. These interfaces encapsulate interactions with external services, such as APIs, third-party systems, or other external components. By creating clear contracts for these operations, the module reinforces Clean Architecture's separation of concerns and ensures that external integrations do not intrude upon the core business logic.

== Java Base Package

The Java base package for this module is: `com.nauth.example.business.service`

== Key Responsibilities

- Define interfaces for operations that interact with external services.
- Abstract away the implementation details of external service interactions, ensuring that the core business logic remains isolated from external components.

== Usage

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/business/service` directory.
2. Define your service interfaces, encapsulating operations that interact with external components.

== Dependencies

This module depend on the following:

- `domain/model` for accessing domain models.
