= Clean Architecture: Business Repository Module

This module is dedicated to defining data repository interfaces that encapsulate database persistence operations. As a crucial component of the `business` layer, the `business-repository` module ensures clear boundaries between core business logic and data storage mechanisms. By enforcing contracts through interfaces, this module enhances maintainability, promotes testing, and adheres to Clean Architecture principles.

== Module Overview

The `business-repository` module plays a pivotal role in maintaining separation between core business domain logic and data persistence operations. Through well-defined repository interfaces, this module outlines the methods and operations required to interact with the database.

== Java Base Package

The Java base package for this module is: `com.nauth.example.business.repository`

== Key Responsibilities

- Define data repository interfaces that represent required data persistence operations for core domain models.
- Enforce clean separation between business logic and data storage through interface-driven development.

== Dependency on the `domain-model` Module

The `business-repository` module depends on the `domain-model` module to establish a clear connection between repository contracts and core domain models. This ensures that the defined repository interfaces align seamlessly with the underlying data structure.

== Configuration Steps

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/business/repository` directory.
2. Open the `build.gradle` file and ensure the necessary dependencies, including `domain-model`, are defined.
3. Define repository interfaces that encapsulate the required data persistence operations for your domain models.
4. Adhere to Clean Architecture principles, focusing on single responsibility and clear separation.


== Example Repository Interface

Consider the example of a repository interface for a hypothetical domain model `User`:

```java
package com.nauth.example.business.repository;

import com.nauth.example.domain.model.User;

public interface UserRepository {
    User findById(Long id);
    List<User> findAll();
    void save(User user);
    void delete(User user);
}
```
