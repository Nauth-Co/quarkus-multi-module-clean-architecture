= Clean Architecture: Infrastructure Properties Module

Welcome to the `infrastructure/properties` module, a cornerstone of streamlined configuration management. This module serves as a dedicated repository for managing configuration properties across the application, providing a clean and organized approach to handling configuration.

== Module Overview

The `infrastructure/properties` module offers a centralized solution for managing configuration properties in the application. By abstracting away the complexities of handling configuration files, this module simplifies the process of mapping properties to Java classes, leading to clean and maintainable code.

== Java Base Package

The Java base package for this module is: `com.nauth.example.infrastructure.properties`

== Key Responsibilities

- Centralize the management of configuration properties for the entire application.
- Simplify the process of mapping configuration properties to Java classes using annotations provided by Quarkus.

== No Dependencies, Just Streamlined Configuration

One distinctive feature of the `infrastructure/properties` module is that it doesn't have any external dependencies. Its primary focus is on providing a streamlined approach to configuration management without introducing unnecessary complexity or additional libraries.

== Configuration Mapping

Here's how to utilize the `infrastructure/properties` module to streamline configuration mapping:

1. Navigate to the `clean-architecture-project/infrastructure/properties` directory.
2. Open the `build.gradle` file and ensure that there are no additional dependencies beyond the standard Java and Gradle plugins.
3. Create Java classes that mirror the structure of your configuration properties.
4. Use annotations provided by Quarkus to map properties from your configuration files to these Java classes.

== Streamlined Configuration, Clean Code

By utilizing the `infrastructure/properties` module, you abstract away the intricacies of configuration files and properties management. This allows developers to focus on the essential aspects of the application while maintaining clean and organized code.
